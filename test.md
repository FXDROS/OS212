2. [Vim beginner until advance](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-beginner/)
   Vim is a popular open source text editor that stands for "Vi Improved". It is uncommon for some people, but this website really tells us how to use vim as a beginner.

3. [Public Key and Private Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4HQ8Bp-pfw)
   Public key and Private key are key pairs that are stored in the encryption and decryption process. So when the private key encrypts data, the public key is used to decrypt the data, this is one of the reasons why the private key cannot be given to just anyone.

5. [What is a TAR file?](https://www.lifewire.com/tar-file-2622386)
   The TAR file format is common in Linux and Unix systems, but only for storing data, not compressing it. This website is interesting because through reading it we'll be able to understand the definition of TAR file, how to make them, and how to convert them.

    Haunted by feelings of insecurity of your password manager is absolutely normal. It is a common for someone being skeptical when it comes to personal data and information. But few of us know that most of password manager use AES 256-bit encryption. It means, it is actually quite safe to use a password manager.

16. [11 Reasons Why Linux Is Better Than Windows](https://itsfoss.com/linux-better-than-windows/)
    Windows is quite familiar among tech users since it is easy to use and not really complicated. Yet, if we are trying to see in "reliability and maintainability" perspective, Linux probably one of the best option. Here's why: Linux is pretty light and rarely need device minimum requirements, as a result, users will not need to buy new hardware because of its incompatibility with the operating system.

17. [Difference Between Mutex and Semaphore](https://afteracademy.com/blog/difference-between-mutex-and-semaphore-in-operating-system)
    Mutex is a mutual exclusion object that allows access to a resource to be synchronized. At the start of a program, it is given a unique name. And then a semaphore is a signaling mechanism. By reading this website you'll get to understand the difference between mutex and semaphore. They also use an example that's very easy to use so that we can understand more about mutex and semaphore.

18. [x86 VS x64 Architecture](https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2020/02/24/what-is-x86-architecture-and-its-difference-between-x64/)
    x86 is referring to 32-bits architecture, while x64 is referring to 64-bits architecture. Well, what's so special about getting twice more than the predecessor machine? The more bits it has, the more it can optimize the usage of your memory(RAM). In other words, x64 architecture could run program faster than x86 architecture.

19. [Space and Time Complexity](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-why-it-matters-and-why-it-doesnt-1674cfa8a23c/)
    In Data Structure and Algorithm course, we are introduced to time complexity; that we define using bigO notation. So, what its correlation with operating system? Simply put, our operating system manage resources allocation for our program. If our program running for a long time, surely it will consume pretty much resource. That's why we need to consider about our program running time.

20. [Game Console Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTVyx4AO18U)
    We do know that our computer has its own operating system; Windows, MacOS, or maybe derivation of Linux such as Ubuntu and Debian. But have we ever thought about gaming consoles' (such as Nintendo Switch, PS5, etc.) operating system?

21. [Clustered File System](https://www.weka.io/learn/clustered-file-system/)
    When servers are bundled into a single cluster, it will be a tough job for an operating system managing the data retrieval. By utilizing clustered file system, an operating system could easily manage data retrieval since it has plenty of alternate nodes. It will be easier as well to share data between every user.

    Concurrency surely brings advantages for our program, since we able to run it asynchronously. But if we are not careful enough, it could makes our program become vulnerable, especially in terms of security. Imagine, we are going to do some money transaction; our security program has not been fully executed, yet our money transaction program already done its job.
