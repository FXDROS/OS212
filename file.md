1. [Virtualization Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZR0rG3HKIk)<br>
   Virtualization is simply make something become virtual, in this term, our machine. We utilize virtualization in order to create virtual machine/virtual environment so that we could save some cost instead of buy another hardware with different OS. For instance, a developer is using WindowsOS and want to test his program at MacOS. Surely, it will cost him pretty much if he buy a MacBook. So, in order to save some cash, it is a better option to use virtual machine.

2. [Vim beginner until advance](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-beginner/)<br>
   Vim is a popular open source text editor that stands for "Vi IMproved". It is uncommon for some people, but this website really tells us how to use vim as a beginner. You should definitely check this tutorial first before using Vim.

3. [Public Key and Private Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4HQ8Bp-pfw)<br>
   Public key and Private key are key pairs that are used for asymmetric encryption and decryption process. So when the private key encrypts data, the public key is used to decrypt the data. This is one of the reasons why the private key cannot be given to just anyone.

4. [How Operating Systems Work](https://data-notes.co/how-operating-systems-work-10-concepts-you-should-know-as-a-developer-8d63bb38331f)<br>
   To make it simple, operating system has similar task as both translator and manager. It helps us translate binary into graphical interfaces as well as manages resources, programs scheduling, and virtualization. By deciding which program needs more resources, which program has to run first, which program could run concurrently, operating system surely helps us a lot.

5. [What is a TAR file?](https://www.lifewire.com/tar-file-2622386)<br>
   The TAR file format is common in Linux and Unix systems, but only for storing data, not compressing it. This website is interesting because through reading it we'll be able to understand the definition of TAR file, how to make them, and how to convert them.

6. [What is Multicore Programming](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-multicore-programming)<br>
   A multicore processor system is essentially a single processor with multiple execution cores in one chip. Multicore programming is, well, how to program stuff that uses the multicore processor system effectively.

7. [SHA-256 Algorithm](https://www.n-able.com/blog/sha-256-encryption)<br>
   SHA-256(Secure Hash Algorithm) is an encryption algorithm used to secure data. While talking about security, hashing means converting data into a secure format, so that no one could access the data unless they have the key. 256 in SHA-256 means 256-bits long; or we can say that every data that is encrypted with SHA-256 hashing will be transformed into 256-bits string.

8. [History of Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB)<br>
   Intermezzo: A crash course that give us a better understanding of operating system and how it works, recalling about its history and understand it comprehensively.

9. [Caching Overview](https://aws.amazon.com/caching/)<br>
   Why does our browser consume pretty much memory but once we restart it, its memory consumption decrease? The reason behind it is caching. Some of our programs are designed to be able to caching. Why do we need it? Caching is quite important to speed up running time since the data are stored in cache (top layer memory), so that we do not have to access lower layer memory such as hard drive and solid state drive.

10. [Asymmetric Encryption](https://www.educba.com/asymmetric-encryption/)<br>
    This article explains the general knowledge you need to know about Asymmetric Encryption. After reading it you should be able to know the pros and cons, also how to use asymmetric encryption.

11. [Which OS is More Secure: Windows, Linux, or macOS?](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/which-is-more-secure-windows-linux-or-macos/)<br>
    Some of us might think that MacOS is better than WindowsOS in term of security, since statistically, WindowsOS is one of the most targeted. Actually, it is not a hundred percent true. WindowsOS being the most targeted because it is more popular and familiar than MacOS. And the fact that WindowsOS is on top of targeted list makes it improve its security system even better each time.

12. [Password Manager](https://cybernews.com/best-password-managers/are-password-managers-safe/)<br>
    Haunted by feelings of insecurity of your password manager is absolutely normal. It is a common for someone being skeptical when it comes to personal data and information. But few of us know that most of password manager use AES 256-bit encryption. It means, it is actually quite safe to use a password manager.

13. [Concurrency Is Not Parallelism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV9rvDllKEg)<br>
    As the title says, those two are completely different, while somewhat similar to an extent. This video will help you further understand, differentiate and learn about both concepts.

14. [Buffer Overflow Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo)<br>
    Simply said, this type of attack abuses the fact that for any computer, there's always exist a buffer limit. By overflowing it, you can potentially break a system, or gain access to the system. This video elaborates more on this specific topic about buffer systems and security.

15. [Thrashing](https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2019/02/thrashing-in-operating-system-os.html)<br>
    As the article says, we need to understand what is page fault and swapping. Those two are correlated with the thrashing mechanism. Thrashing is when the page fault and then swapping happening very frequently at a higher rate, the operating system has to spend more time swapping these pages.

16. [11 Reasons Why Linux Is Better Than Windows](https://itsfoss.com/linux-better-than-windows/)<br>
    Windows is quite familiar among tech users since it is easy to use and not really complicated. Yet, if we are trying to see in "reliability and maintainability" perspective, Linux probably one of the best option. Here's why: Linux is pretty light and rarely need device minimum requirements, as a result, users will not need to buy new hardware because of its incompatibility with the operating system.

17. [Difference Between Mutex and Semaphore](https://afteracademy.com/blog/difference-between-mutex-and-semaphore-in-operating-system)<br>
    Mutex is a mutual exclusion object that allows access to a resource to be synchronized. At the start of a program, it is given a unique name. And then a semaphore is a signaling mechanism. By reading this website you'll get to understand the difference between mutex and semaphore. They also use an example that's very easy to use so that we can understand more about mutex and semaphore.

18. [x86 VS x64 Architecture](https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2020/02/24/what-is-x86-architecture-and-its-difference-between-x64/)<br>
    x86 is referring to 32-bits architecture, while x64 is referring to 64-bits architecture. Well, what's so special about getting twice more than the predecessor machine? The more bits it has, the more it can optimize the usage of your memory(RAM). In other words, x64 architecture could run program faster than x86 architecture.

19. [Space and Time Complexity](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-why-it-matters-and-why-it-doesnt-1674cfa8a23c/)<br>
    In Data Structure and Algorithm course, we are introduced to time complexity; that we define using bigO notation. So, what its correlation with operating system? Simply put, our operating system manage resources allocation for our program. If our program running for a long time, surely it will consume pretty much resource. That's why we need to consider about our program running time.

20. [Game Console Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTVyx4AO18U)<br>
    We do know that our computer has its own operating system; Windows, MacOS, or maybe derivation of Linux such as Ubuntu and Debian. But have we ever thought about gaming console's (such as Nintendo Switch, PS5, etc.) operating system?

21. [Clustered File System](https://www.weka.io/learn/clustered-file-system/)<br>
    When servers are bundled into a single cluster, it will be a tough job for an operating system managing the data retrieval. By utilizing clustered file system, an operating system could easily manage data retrieval since it has plenty of alternate nodes. It will be easier as well to share data between every user.

22. [Why We Need Virtual File System](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/virtual-filesystems-linux)<br>
    Simply put, without Virtual File System, the creation of Linux is impossible. The very definition of VFS is that "Everything is a File". With VFS, the linux kernel can operate, use, and deal with basically everything that exists as a filesystem.

23. [MBR vs GPT Which Should You Use?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch9f7i0hj90)<br>
    Previously, we would not have to store more than about 2TB in our personal computer; that is why it is totally fine to use MBR partition. But, nowadays, we surely need lots of space to store our data, some might need more than 3TB. It is kinda impossible to do so with MBR, since MBR only gives you 2TB of space, even though you have 4TB hard drive. So, it will be better to use GPT and boot it using UEFI instead of BIOS.

24. [How Risky is Updating Your BIOS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3y-r06Mq2M)<br>
    BIOS stored in a separated chip in our hardware. So, updating your BIOS means rewriting the whole chip to contain the new firmware and the updated version of the BIOS. So, where is the risky part? We know when we download a file from the internet, that file might be corrupted or incomplete. We know our hard drive files could be corrupted when our hardware is shut down while writing or reading something. Same goes as updating your BIOS, once your BIOS is corrupted, it will be nearly impossible to start your computer.

25. [Hacking Banks With Race Conditions](https://vickieli.dev/hacking/race-conditions/)<br>
    Concurrency surely brings advantages for our program, since we able to run it asynchronously. But if we are not careful enough, it could makes our program become vulnerable, especially in terms of security. Imagine, we are going to do some money transaction; our security program has not been fully executed, yet our money transaction program already done its job.

26. [Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
    Modern operating systems use paging to manage memory. In this process, physical memory is divided into fixed-sized blocks called frames and logical memory into blocks of the same size called pages. When paging is used, a logical address is divided into two parts: a page number and a page offset. The page number serves as an index into a perprocess page table that contains the frame in physical memory that holds the page. The offset is the specific location in the frame being referenced.

27. [Translation-Look-Aside_Buffer](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/)<br>
    A translation look-aside buffer (TLB) is a hardware cache of the page table. Each TLB entry contains a page number and its corresponding frame.
    Using a TLB in address translation for paging systems involves obtaining the page number from the logical address and checking if the frame for the page is in the TLB. If it is, the frame is obtained from the TLB. If the frame is not present in the TLB, it must be retrieved from the page table.

28. [Memory hierarchy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy)<br>
    The memory hierarchy separates computer storage into a hierarchy based on response time. Since response time, complexity, and capacity are related, the levels may also be distinguished by their performance and controlling technologies.
    As can be seen on this diagram https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy#/media/File:ComputerMemoryHierarchy.svg the highest is processor register, the middle is RAM, and the lower are hard drives and tape backup.

29. [Memory vs Storage and its history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQCr9RV7twk)<br>
    From the POK course we know that computer memory is volatile. There is also storage, any data like hard drive will be there until deleted or overwritten, even if the power goes down.
    The crash course video I linked above explains the history of memory and storage from before 1950 up until now. What we utilize affordably and easily for now is the result of re-inventing and trial and errors! It talks about delay line memory, stored-program computer (Edvac) or sequential memory, magnetic core memory, MIT’s whirlwind computer (predominant RAM at the time) which can access any data unlike delay memory, solid state drive -> no moving part like optical disk or compact disk, but slower than computer RAM. That’s why comp still use memory hierarchy.

30. [Logical vs Physical Address](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-physical-and-logical-address-space)<br>
    An address generated by the CPU is known as a logical address, which the memory management unit (MMU) translates to a physical address in memory. It is important to compare the process size with the physical address space, which must be less than physical address space. The javapoint web is a good resource to learn memory management topic.

31. [Understanding Big and Little Endian Byte Order](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-big-and-little-endian-byte-order/)<br>

33. [vRAM vs RAM: What’s The Difference?](https://levvvel.com/vram-vs-ram/)<br>
    RAM is used for storing temporary file systems, but vRAM stores image data. Most of the time More RAM means better, but for vRAM, it isn’t always the case. Why? Because it also depends on the graphic card, sometimes a graphic card boasting more vRAM will perform worse than a lower vRAM because of the superior chips, bandwidths, and wider memory bus (Try reading the difference between RTX 3060 and RTX 3060Ti).

34. [DIMM vs SO-DIMM: Characteristics, Definition and Differences](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/what-is-little-endian-and-big-endian/)<br>
    When we talk about RAM oriented to the consumer (we, the users), we can find it in two different formats: either in DIMM format, which is the usual “full size” that we see on desktop PCs, or in the SO- format. DIMM, smaller and oriented to laptops and mini PCs.

35. [Memory Protection](https://lwn.net/Articles/643797/)<br>
    Memory protection is a way to control memory access rights on a computer, and is a part of most modern instruction set architectures and operating systems. The main purpose of memory protection is to prevent a process from accessing memory that has not been allocated to it. This prevents a bug or malware within a process from affecting other processes, or the operating system itself.

36. [Static vs. Shared Libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vp9cFQCQCo)<br>

    This site cover address binding with the help of an example and Its types like compile time, load time, and execution time address binding.

38. [Hardware Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hardware-protection-and-type-of-hardware-protection/)<br>
    A computer system contains the hardware like processor, monitor, RAM, and many more. The operating system ensures that these devices can not directly accessible by the user. This website explain about the type if hardware protection such as CPU protection, Memory protection, and I/O protection.

39. [Bi-Endianness?](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/bi-endian)<br>
    Apparently, some machines have the ability to switch between big endian and little endian ordering. Hence why it’s called a bi-endian. Mindblowing. It’s almost like being ambidextrous but for computers.

40. [Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) in Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/translation-lookaside-buffer-tlb-in-paging/)<br>
    In Operating System, for each process page table will be created, which will contain Page Table Entry (PTE). This PTE will contain information like frame number (The address of main memory where we want to refer), and some other useful bits (e.g., valid/invalid bit, dirty bit, protection bit etc).

41. [ExplainShell](https://explainshell.com/)<br>
    ExplainShell is a website to learn command interactively and knows what that command does.

42. [How Do Linux File Permissions Work?](https://www.howtogeek.com/67987/htg-explains-how-do-linux-file-permissions-work/)<br>
    Linux has simple system of file permission and it's really easy to understand it. Basically, each user has a relationship with a file or a directory on whether it can see, write or execute it. Besides that, we can also set group permissions which makes linux one of the best operating system to handle permissions.

43. [Linux File System/Structure Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw) <br>
    In linux, folders are arranged by similar names on each distribution. In the video, the file system and structure of every directory is explained. Some of them are similar even in UNIX based operating system like Mac OS. Even though Windows's file system and structures are different. You can also learn more even how Windows file system works.

44. [What is Linux swap?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgefj9ibRE) <br> \***\*Swap space is basically the way out if your RAM run out of memory. Basically the Linux Kernel will take some information from the RAM and will take the information to the swap space to free some of it and doesn’t crash due to lack of memory. It’s just like an **additional memory for your operating systems\*\* 📝. For the forum, you can [read it here.](https://askubuntu.com/questions/49109/i-have-16gb-ram-do-i-need-32gb-swap) Well, the golden rule is the Swap Area is usually twice the size of your RAM, but it also depends on the ability for your computer to hibernate. Also, it depends on the speed of your hard drive, some say that it’s not recommended to have large swap space if you use SSD as it will decrease it write cycle and life span. So, Yeah! You should read some of those articles about swap space.

45. [Make File (Colored Documentations + Forum)](https://makefiletutorial.com/)<br> \***\*So, make file is essentially a script that lets you `make file`, usually it consists of some several commands to let you compile something or just **arrange some things into a/some file(s)\*\*. [what is the difference between a makefile and a shell script?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3798562/why-use-make-over-a-shell-script) The answer is: It’s easier, and makefile is dedicated for it. There are even topological features which lets you save a progress if it’s already been done, or lets you run some different flags when making those files 📁.

46. [Tree queries for O(nq) (10’ Article)](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/67001)<br>
    \*\*\*\*⌚ If you’re into competitive programming, this is a total good read. I will explain to you first why is this interesting. So, In C++ (It’s really similar to C). Usually in 1 second ⌚ you can do like approximately 10e8 processes (Competitive programming approximations). But, somehow and sometimes. The compiler can optimize your code, those bad constants can be put down to really small 🐜.
    So, with the advantages of cache hit you can fit up to 10e10 processes! How? Essentialy, loop through optimal pages, pages that are already in the physical memory, rather than going through tons and tons of page fault 📃.

But how to [check the CPU Speed through Linux Terminal?](https://linoxide.com/check-cpu-speed-on-linux/) There are also lots of ways. Simply do `lscpu`. It’s so interesting because this site will show you how to check your basic environment hardware you’re working with 😉. Or simply just check the specifications of the server you’re give.

48. [All You Need To Know About Processes in Linux [Comprehensive Guide] (3’ Article)](https://www.tecmint.com/linux-process-management/)<br>
    A **process** refers to a program in execution; it’s a running instance of a program. A new process is normally created when an existing process makes an exact copy of itself in memory. The child process will have the same environment as its parent 🤼, but only the process ID number is different. **Init** process is the mother (parent) of all processes on the system, it’s the first program that is executed when the [Linux system boots up](https://www.tecmint.com/linux-boot-process/); it manages all other processes on the system. It is started by the kernel itself, so in principle it does not have a parent process.

49. [Chinese Magical Hard-Drive (Blog Posts + Explanation Video)](https://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/198-chinese-magical-hard-drive/)<br>
    **[](https://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/198-chinese-magical-hard-drive/)**[This is the explanation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-D6tYBX8vE)  It’s a public secret that **some cheap** chinese products are just some bad rip-offs of good brands with some bad spells involved in it.. In the blog and video we can see some people bought Terabytes of MicroSD and Hard-Drive for a really cheap price. Turns out, the capacity shown is not true. This is caused by the **forged metadata of FAT32 or exFAT, even worse the hardware metadata is also forged**! The video and post is interesting because we all can see that even well known file systems got some flaws in it. Well not just that.. generally, external drives hardware actually got another second chip (microcontroller) that stores some extra metadatas that is forged by the bad people in general. What a scam world we live in \

50. [25 Years of Linux in 5 minutes and BSD, Linux, POSIX, UNIX Playlist (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFTIc5frqw8&list=PLU_Er81tl-Vka_GPCCakU6NLuyVh5QICp)<br>
    UNIX is an operating systems invented by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at the Bell Labs Research Center. It was a commercial product sold by AT&T. Linux is a Kernel which was invented by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki. A kernel is a program that always run, so it’s just a software and not as complete/full as UNIX. See Linux as an engine, and UNIX as a car. It’s more like a ripoff or clone of UNIX. It’s open source, unlike UNIX. For extra pepper, you can read [What is the very fundamental difference between Unix, Linux, BSD and GNU?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/104714/what-is-the-difference-between-unix-linux-bsd-and-gnu) and watch [Unix vs Linux Difference Between Linux and Unix Intellipaat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_T0b77so4g). By then, macOS is still a descendant of UNIX. As for POSIX, it’s a standard command interface. You can read more at [What is the meaning of POSIX?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1780599/what-is-the-meaning-of-posix).

51. [Will ‘Htop’ Replace Default ‘Top’ Monitoring Tool in Linux?](https://www.tecmint.com/htop-vs-top-in-linux/)<br>
    Top is a traditional command-line tool for monitoring real-time processes in a Unix/Linux systems, it’s comes preinstalled on most if not all Linux distributions and shows a useful summary of system information including uptime, the total number of processes (and number of: running, sleeping, stopped and zombie processes), CPU and RAM usage, and a list of processes or threads currently being managed by the kernel.

52. [Memory-mapped IO vs Port-mapped IO](https://www.bogotobogo.com/Embedded/memory_mapped_io_vs_port_mapped_isolated_io.php)<br>
    Microprocessors normally use two methods to connect external devices: memory mapped or port mapped I/O. However, as far as the peripheral is concerned, both methods are really identical.

53. [CPU Scheduling in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)<br>
    A typical process involves both I/O time and CPU time. In a uni programming system like MS-DOS, time spent waiting for I/O is wasted and the CPU is free during this time. In multiprogramming systems, one process can use a CPU while another is waiting for I/O. This is possible only with process scheduling.

54. [Deadline scheduler in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadline-scheduler-in-operating-system/)<br>
    Deadline Scheduler is n I/O scheduler for the Linux kernel and guarantees a start service time for a request. Deadline Scheduler imposes deadlines on all I/O operations in order to prevent wanted requests. Two deadlines read and write queues (basically sorted by their deadline) are maintained. For every new request, the scheduler selects which queue will serve for it. Read queues are given high priority than write queues because during reading operations the processes usually get blocked.

55. [Paging and Segmentation](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/hardware/paging-and-segmentation/)<br>  
    Paging is a memory management technique in which process address space is broken into blocks of the same size called pages while segmentation is a memory management technique in which each job is divided into several segments of different sizes. Paging and segmentation are processes by which data is stored, then retrieved from the computer's storage disk. This website will dig deeper into the meaning, process, and key differences between paging and segmentation.

56. [How To Optimize The Paging File In Windows](https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/how-to-optimize-the-paging-file-in-windows/)<br>
    If Windows ever warned you that your system is low on virtual memory, it is worth knowing how to manage and increase Pagefile (virtual memory) in Windows 10. The Windows Page File, also called a paging file or swap file, is a file used to temporarily store data. This website will discuss tips to improve paging performance and why we should optimize the paging file.

57. [Cache Memory in Computer Organization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cache-memory-in-computer-organization/)<br>
    Cache Memory is a small memory that is temporary. The data or contents of the main memory that are used frequently by CPU are stored in the cache memory so that the processor can easily access that data in a shorter time. Whenever the CPU needs to access memory, it first checks the cache memory. If the data is not found in cache memory, CPU will move into the main memory. On this website will be discussed about the memory level, type, performance, and mapping of the cache.

58. [Techniques to handle Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)<br>

    Password manager not only allows you to stop remembering passwords but they also stop you from typing those cumbersome letters. But which one should you use? Are the ones being advertise to you are safe? If care less about portability and more into security you could use the unix password manager known as pass. It works just as any password manager, the catch is the only way you could access the passwords is by providing the GPG key you initialize it with. Meaning unless you give it to anyone else your password is safe.

64. [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)<br>
    FZF is a neat little tool that makes navigation through the command line much much easier. You could scout through folders to find a file, jump to the folder, or repeat a command from history. You could also use it to see through a git remote, logs, branches, etc. It's really versatile.

65. [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Getting-Started)<br>
    Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that can be attached and detached at any given time. It allows you to open multiple terminals and store it in a session.

66. [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
    Virtual Memory is a storage allocation scheme in which secondary memory can be addressed as though it were part of the main memory. The addresses a program may use to reference memory are distinguished from the addresses the memory system uses to identify physical storage sites, and program-generated addresses are translated automatically to the corresponding machine addresses.

67. [Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption: What's the Difference?](https://www.trentonsystems.com/blog/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption)<br>
    Symmetric encryption is a widely used data encryption technique whereby data is encrypted and decrypted using a single, secret cryptographic key. Asymmetric encryption or public-key cryptography or public-key encryption uses mathematically linked public-key and private-key pairs to encrypt and decrypt senders’ and recipients’ sensitive data.

68. [Single-threaded and Multi-threaded Processes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/single-threaded-and-multi-threaded-processes)<br>
    Single-threaded processes contain the execution of instructions in a single sequence. In other words, one command is processed at a time. The opposite of single-threaded processes is multithreaded processes. These processes allow the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. These are lightweight processes available within the process.

69. [Process Synchronization in Operating System](https://my.eng.utah.edu/~cs5460/slides/Lecture07.pdf)<br>
    Basic ideas behind most synchronization: If two threads, processes, interrupt handlers, etc. are going to have conflicting accesses, force one of them to wait until it is safe to proceed. Synchronization problems are: (1) synchronization can be required for different resources (2) there are different kinds of synchronization problems (3) synchronization may be across machines (4) sometimes it’s not OK to block a thread or process.

70. [Concurrency vs. Parallelism — A brief view](https://medium.com/@itIsMadhavan/concurrency-vs-parallelism-a-brief-review-b337c8dac350)<br>
    Concurrency means that an application is making progress on more than one task at the same time (concurrently) while parallelism means that an application splits its tasks up into smaller subtasks that can be processed in parallel, for instance on multiple CPUs at the exact same time.

73. [fork() Bomb](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-bomb/)
    Fork Bomb is a program that harms a system by making it run out of memory. It forks processes infinitely to fill memory. The fork bomb is a form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack against a Linux-based system. This page has the explanation for `fork()` bomb script and more detailed information about `fork()` bomb.

74. [fork() in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/)
    The fork system call is one of the important topics that you should know in the Operating system subject. Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the `fork()` call (parent process). Visit this page to read more explanations about `fork()` in C.

75. [Daemon](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/daemon.7.html)<br>
    Daemon is a service process that runs on background and manages background process.

76. [Zombie process](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-zombie-process-in-linux)<br>
    Zombie process is a process is a process that completed but still have entry in the process table. Zombie process usually occurred for child process.

77. [init system](https://fedoramagazine.org/what-is-an-init-system/)<br>
    init system is the first process that started after the kernel started. Init system will run other needed process that the kernel needed.

78. [systemd](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/what-is-systemd/)<br>
    systemd is a init system that used in many of linux distro. Systemd created by fedora and used in debian, ubuntu, arch and other distro.

79. [fuse](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html))<br>
    Fuse is a userspace filesystem that have kernel module, userpsace library and a mount utiity. Fuse allowed non-privilaged mount.

80. [Socket programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/)<br>
    A socket is a communications connection point (endpoint) that you can name and address in a network. Socket programming shows how to use socket APIs to establish communication links between remote and local processes.

81. [Mulithreading Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ENFeb-J75k)<br />
    Multithreading is a technique used by computers to make sure that system resources are utilized to it's best efficiency, by executing multiple threads or instructions at a time. This allows programs that contain multiple threads to share resources, such as memory.

82. [Bounded Buffer Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRiN3DJdskA)<br />
    Also called as the "producer-consumer problem", it is a demonstration of problems that might come from the implementation of multithreading on a process. It describes a producer, a consumer, and a buffer of finite size. The producer has to put a "product" in the buffer, for the consumer to "consume" it. The problem arises when the buffer is either full or empty. If it is full, the producer will "waste" it's product. Likewise, the consumer will waste a cycle "waiting" for a product that isn't there. The solution to this problem is by making "counters" that check how many empty spaces a buffer has, and another one that counts how many full spaces a buffer has. That way, when the buffer is empty/full, the consumer/producer can sleep for that cycle, and free up memory

83. [Context Switching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKmBRl8j3Ak)<br />
    Context switching is a way to implement computational multitasking, by saving the execution state of a thread while another thread is being executed. By this technique, it is possible for a single CPU to execute multiple threads at once.

84. [Page File](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VDP5TCAK2c)<br />
    A page file is a file (duh) where the operating system saves data that is not recently used/of a lower priority from a higher level storage to a lower one (typically from the RAM to disk). This allows the system to have a theoretically larger memory than what is physically available. In modern consumer systems with large memory, it is often not required.

85. [Interrupts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54BrU82ANww)<br />
    Interrupts are a special signal sent by hardware to notify the system that it requires a service by the Interrupt Handler. It is usually used to handle events such as a button being pressed, a new device being connected, etc., and allows the system to be more "responsive"

86. [Von Neumann Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml3-kVYLNr8)<br />
    A video explaining the Von Neumann Architecture and it's history. The Von Neumann Architecture is a very simple computer architecture, that we largely still follow today. It was developed during the wartime period, and it consists of a storage medium (Memory), a control unit (CPU) an arithmetic unit (ALU), and an input and output.

87. [Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<br /> Computers keep getting faster and faster, and by the start of the 1950s they had gotten so fast that it often took longer to manually load programs via punch cards than to actually run them! The solution was the operating system (or OS), which is just a program with special privileges that allows it to run and manage other programs. So today, we’re going to trace the development of operating systems from the Multics and Atlas Supervisor to Unix and MS-DOS, and take a look at how these systems heavily influenced popular OSes like Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android that we use today.

88. [Socket Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4kr7EFxAKk)<br />
    We have many machines and we have all nodes, it can be a server or a client
    it can be a client to client network, we all this node talking to each other, Basically it is pair to pair network. In this video we will understand base of the internet or network, Which is socket.
    And we have to understand two concept first one is Port numbers and second one is type of connection going to build. We will talk about TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) & UDP( User Datagram Protocol). Tcp is connection oriented network, Udp is Connection less network.

89. [Cryptograph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-JjHa-qLPk)<br /> Explains how cryptography allows for the secure transfer of data online. This video explains 256-bit encryption, public and private keys, SSL & TLS and HTTPS.

90. [Process and Threads in OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITc09gOrqZk)<br />In this video, difference between Process and threads explained with real life examples. students always feel confused in this topic but after watching this video you will be able to solve the questions easily. Fork questions are asked in competitive exams like GATE, NTA NET, NIELIT, DSSSB tgt/ pgt computer science, KVS CSE, PSUs etc and college university exams also.

91. [Memory in OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q5zWCw8J4)<br>
    In many ways, our memories make us who we are, helping us remember our past, learn and retain skills, and plan for the future. And for the computers that often act as extensions of ourselves, memory plays much the same role. Kanawat Senanan explains how computer memory works.

92. [Learn AWK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YOZmI-zWok)
    AWK is a command-line-based text-processing program which is very useful to extract useful information from raw data, especially from other programs. This video walks through some basic AWK use-cases and basic commands which are often used in real-life, including reated apps such as `uniq`.

93. [OpenRC](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/OpenRC)<br/>
    An alternative systemd, considered to be the goto if you considered systemd to be bloated. There's not much difference between the two.

94. [Critical Section](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-70/)<br />
    When more than one processes access a same code segment that segment is known as critical section. Critical section contains shared variables or resources which are needed to be synchronized to maintain consistency of data variable.

95. [Simple Chaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FyXURRVmR0)<br />
    Caches are used everywhere in our modern devices. It's found in many hardware components and throughout software. The goal of caching is to store data from slow memory into fast memory so it can be retrieved quicker.

96. [Starvation and Aging in Priority Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01DiVzZbRjY)
    Operating systems surely will allocate our computer resources to processes with higher priorities. Imagine it as a queue, they who have higher priority level will be served first than the lower one. But what if, while queuing, someone with high priority keeps coming? Then we guess that those with lower priority will never be served. <br>

97. [What Is a File System, and Why Are There So Many of Them?](https://www.howtogeek.com/196051/)
    File system is simply how an operating system manage its files. For example, there are two types of person in arranging their books. One order them by the color of the cover and the other arrange them by their heights. Similar with file system, different operating system works with their own file system. <br>

98. [File Allocation Methods](https://www.tutorialandexample.com/file-allocation-methods/)
    We save our files in our computer and that's it; we let our operating system manage the file allocation and resources which are necessary to keep our files. But how do an operating system manages our files? Basically, it treats our files as blocks. The bigger it is, the more block it will need. There are several file allocation methods; on of it is linked-list allocation, where those blocks are scattered yet connected through a linking "string" that makes it looks like a list. <br>

99. [User Accounts, Groups, Permissions & Their Role in Sharing](https://www.howtogeek.com/school/windows-network-sharing/lesson1/)
    If we look closely at our computer, we realize that it probably only has one hard drive, yet could be accessed by several users. Well, users are basically "special" folders that need some kind of credential if you want to access any of it. The admin, is similar as those folders manager, that have access and right to every folder that exist in the device. <br>

100. [Deadlock And Its Prevention And Avoidance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-prevention/)
     Deadlock is a condition when a set (or more) processes are not able to complete because each processes are holding resources that is needed by the other processes. At this situation, it will end up as a circular wait. As an illustration, there are two goats on a bridge. Each of them want to cross the bridge and end up meeting each other at the center of the bridge. None of them is willing to step back, letting the other pass. As a result, a deadlock occurs. <br>

101. [Building a Fuse Filesystem](https://medium.com/@cris178/building-a-fuse-file-system-ee8f90fd0a2f)
     FUSE(Filesystem USErspace) is a file system framework that allows any user to create his/her own folder without modifying the kernel code. FUSE is specified for Linux distribution that supports FUSE kernel module. Through this link, you may be able to build FUSE by utilizing `Libfuse`. <br>
